## Selected Projects

### 🚲 City Exploration – Bike Safety & Infrastructure Risk Analysis (Boston)
🔗 [City Exploration – Project Page](projects/city-exploration/)

**Question:** Why do certain Bluebikes stations in Boston consistently experience higher numbers of bicycle-related accidents, despite overall improvements in bike infrastructure?

**Data & Methods:**  
- Vision Zero crash data (2015, 2024), Bluebikes station locations, distance-based spatial proximity analysis (st_is_within_distance), GIS mapping

**Key Insights:**  
- Identified persistent high-risk stations across both years  
- Found strong association between accident hotspots and shared or unprotected bike lanes  
- Highlighted the importance of physical separation in bike infrastructure design


### 🚴 Bikeshare Equity Analysis (Boston)
🔗 [Bikeshare Equity Analysis – Project Page](projects/bikeshare-equity/)

**Question:** Is Bikeshare Really Equally Accessible and Affordable to Everyone in Boston?

**Data & Methods:**  
- Bluebikes trip data (2015, 2019), ACS data, H+T Index, regression analysis (R), GIS mapping

**Key Insights:**  
- Bikeshare usage increased in low-income areas alongside major network expansion, yet income-based disparities persisted in regression results


### 🏠 Homelessness Trends (NY, CA)
🔗 [People on the Streets – Project Page](projects/homelessness/)

**Question:** How have homelessness patterns changed between 2010 and 2020 across major U.S. regions?

**Data & Methods:**  
- CoC-based homelessness data, ACS socioeconomic indicators, GIS spatial analysis, StoryMaps

**Key Insights:**  
- Temporary declines during COVID-19 aligned with eviction moratoria and emergency rental assistance, followed by sharp rebounds after program expiration
- Short-term relief prevented deeper crises but failed to address structural housing shortages; long-term solutions such as Housing First are critical for sustainable impact
