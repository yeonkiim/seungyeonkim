# 🚴 Bikeshare Equity Analysis – Boston

## Research Question
Is bikeshare equally accessible and affordable across neighborhoods in Boston following the launch of the **SNAP Card to Ride** low-income membership program (2018)?

## Background
Boston’s Bluebikes introduced a discounted membership initiative (“SNAP Card to Ride”) to improve access for residents eligible for public benefit programs.  
This project explores demographic and socioeconomic patterns in Bluebikes usage **before and after** the program launch, focusing on **2015 (pre)** and **2019 (post)**.

## Data & Methods
- **Bluebikes trip / usage data:** 2015 and 2019  
- **Neighborhood socioeconomic data:** ACS (census tract level)  
- **Cost / accessibility context:** Housing + Transportation (H+T) Index  
- **Methods:** Regression analysis (R), GIS mapping, spatial comparison of station distribution and ridership patterns

## Key Findings
- Bikeshare usage increased in low-income census tracts between 2015 and 2019.
- During the same period, Boston’s bikeshare network expanded substantially (hundreds of new stations), which likely improved physical access across neighborhoods.
- Regression results suggest that **income-based disparities persisted**, and relationships were not uniformly significant across all measures, reflecting the exploratory and short-term nature of the evaluation.

## Policy Implications
- Discounted memberships may support inclusion, but **affordability alone is not sufficient** to ensure equitable access.
- **Station density and proximity** appear to be as influential as pricing in shaping usage patterns.
