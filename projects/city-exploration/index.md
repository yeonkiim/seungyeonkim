# 🚲 City Exploration – Bike Safety & Infrastructure Risk Analysis (Boston)

## Research Question
Why do certain Bluebikes stations in Boston consistently experience higher bicycle accident rates despite overall improvements in bike infrastructure?

## Data & Methods
- Vision Zero crash data (2015, 2024)
- Bluebikes station location data
- Distance-based spatial proximity analysis (`st_is_within_distance`)
- GIS mapping and infrastructure classification

## Key Findings
- Persistent high-risk stations across both years
- Strong association with shared or unprotected bike lanes
- High exposure along major vehicular corridors

## Policy Implications
Improving bike safety requires qualitative upgrades to infrastructure,
particularly physical separation in high-risk areas.
