# 🏠 People on the Streets – Homelessness Trends (New York & California)

## Research Question
How have homelessness patterns changed in New York and California between 2010 and 2020?
Was there a period during which homelessness declined, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic?

## Background
Homelessness is driven by complex structural factors, but a critical contributor remains the growing gap between housing affordability and income growth.
This project examines long-term homelessness trends in two major U.S. regions to understand how policy interventions and market conditions intersect over time.

## Data & Methods
- **Homelessness data:** CoC-based counts (2010–2020)
- **Socioeconomic indicators:** ACS data (poverty rates, rent burden, median rent)
- **Methods:** GIS spatial analysis, regional comparison
- **Communication:** ArcGIS StoryMaps for spatial storytelling and policy interpretation

## Key Findings
- Homelessness trends varied by region but remained closely linked to housing affordability pressures.
- During the COVID-19 pandemic, temporary declines or stabilization were observed in some areas.
- These shifts coincided with eviction moratoria and emergency rental assistance programs.
- Following the expiration of these programs, homelessness rebounded sharply, revealing the fragility of short-term interventions.

## Policy Implications
- Temporary relief measures were effective in preventing a deeper crisis but insufficient to address structural housing shortages.
- Shelter capacity and support services remain inadequate relative to growing demand.
- Long-term policy responses must focus on affordability, housing supply, and income stability to achieve lasting impact.
